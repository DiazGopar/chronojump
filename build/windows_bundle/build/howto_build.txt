1: install mingw (automated mingw installer, do minimal install)
http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/
2: install msys
http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/
3: install mono in a dir without spaces

go to build 
edit mkbundle.sh change MONO_INSTALL_PATHY to where it's installed mono 
(HAS TO BE A PATH WITHOUT SPACES, like c:\mono)

(there were problems with dos2unix: broken pipe. But now we don't use and there aren't problems

on mingw/msys, go to build, execute:
$sh makeBundle.sh
this takes the last compiled prg and generates exe on bin directory

then with innosetup we can create the installer that is ok because installs the driver and puts the gtk_prefs on the "start" folder
