PRE
1: install mingw (automated mingw installer, do minimal install)
http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/
2: install msys
http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/
3: install mono in a dir without spaces

In 'Makefile.win32'change MONO_INSTALL_PATH to the Mono installation folder (eg: MONO_INSTALL_PATH=/c/Mono-2.4)
MONO HAS TO BE INSTALLED IN A PATH WIHTOUT SPACES

on mingw/msys, go to bundle folder and run:

$cd /c/chronojump/windows_bundle
$make -f Makefile.win32

It compiles Chronojump and Chronojump_mini, creates the bundle and install it in the bin folder.
If we have made changes to the sources we need to delete the genereated files in order to rebuild 
Chronojump and Chronojump_mini:

$make -f Makefile.win32 clean
$make -f Makefile.win32

then with innosetup we can create the installer that is ok because installs the driver and puts the gtk_prefs on the "start" folder:
open chronojump_innosetup.iss on build folder
change version AT TWO PLACES:
-AppVerName
-OutputBaseFilename

compile
