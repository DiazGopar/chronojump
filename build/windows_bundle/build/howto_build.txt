PRE
1: install mingw (automated mingw installer, do minimal install)
http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/
2: install msys
http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/
3: install mono in a dir without spaces

go to build 
edit mkbundle.sh change MONO_INSTALL_PATH to where it's installed mono 
(HAS TO BE A PATH WITHOUT SPACES, like c:\mono)

(there were problems with dos2unix: broken pipe. But now we don't use and there aren't problems

After creating the release with make
copy the windows_bundle as eg: chronojump-0.8.9.8 and put it on windows machine at C:\

on mingw/msys, go to build:
cd /c/chronojump-0.8.9.8/build/

, execute:
$sh makeBundle.sh
this takes the last compiled prg and generates exe on bin directory

then with innosetup we can create the installer that is ok because installs the driver and puts the gtk_prefs on the "start" folder:
open chronojump_innosetup.iss on build folder
change version AT TWO PLACES:
-AppVerName
-OutputBaseFilename

compile
