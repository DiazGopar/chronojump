<h4><b>ChronoJump</b> is a complete multiplatform system for measurement, management and statistics of the jump events. </h4>

Chronojump uses a contact platform suitable for two events (in-platform, out-platform), and also a chronometer printed circuit designed <i>ad-hoc</i> in order to obtain precise and trustworthy measurements.
<p>
The flight time of a jump is an indicator of the elevation of the Center of gravity of the jumper (as long as the starting and arrival position are the same).
