sdcc -mpic14 -p16f876a -Wl-m -Wl-ainhx8m chronopic-firmware-4MHz.c
sdcc -mpic14 -p16f876a -Wl-m -Wl-ainhx8m chronopic-firmware-20MHz.c

then record with chronopic-firmwarecord

IMPORTANT:
there's a bug:
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/sdcc/+bug/1077918
that makes compiling with pics impossible.
Solution is to manually (dpkg -i) install lenny packages:

http://archive.debian.net/lenny/i386/sdcc/download
http://archive.debian.net/lenny/electronics/sdcc-libraries

this sdcc-libraries (2.8.0) has 
pic16f876a.h
pic16f876a.lib

but all the 3.0 and above doesn't have them

trying
sdcc -mpic14 -p16f876 -Wl-m -Wl-ainhx8m chronopic-firmware-4MHz-16f876.c
but created hex file is the same than in "a" version
