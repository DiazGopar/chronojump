repair bug in exiting when graphs are displayed (is for the old DLL?)

make that serial connection can be stablished regardless before a modem has been used in the same port

repair bug in treeviews, jumper's get not automatically expanded when make the first jump

study how to make IE, IUB (the best two SJ,CMJ and CMJ,ABK; or the worst and the best)

stats: 
	show all jump types in combo_stats
	manage the new simple jump types depending on "weight" and "fall"

graphs:
	study licensing problems of NPlot or how to include it
	put a button for refreshing the graph
	make graphs for all stats

show better info in the RJ jump edit

implement the simulated tj rime

make appbar2.push show the different jumps as the are producing in RJ:
chronojump.cs, lines: 
			Console.WriteLine("trama: {0} {1} {2}", t0, t1, realTime(t2, t3) );
			string myString = "prova " + t0 + ", " + t1 + ", " + realTime(t2, t3) ;
			appbar2.Push( myString );


preference for wait until finish jump in RJ limited by time or don't wait

edit jump need the hability of change the DJ fall and the SJ+ weight

make an edit session and a delete session, the class, probably heredate from sessionload. The widget win is another


- make the currentUser change when a user is selected in the treeview (with double click)
 (or edit this user)

(altura DJ ?). Aixo funciona, pero no agafa la linia si falta algun salt:

we can check the lines we need, and execute, and if a line it's not found, try to discover wich values are needed
