TODO: 


new multichronopic tests:
- padu runAnalysis (2cp)
- discrimitative reaction time with two lights and two fotocells (or platforms)
(4cp) when evaluator push left or right button, cp 1 or cp2 lights, person has to cross fotocell a or b (connected to cp 3, 4)
better with only two chronopics, if evaluator push cp1, light1 gets on and person has tocross fotocell1 (or platform). Then with two we have all.
we can also have three or four to have more discriminative

fix graph problems on multichronopic (also when there's only a chronopic)


mirar fallo al tancar finestra executar fent click a X
abans o després de cancelar
i mirar la minifinestra que surt (de d'acord) que es pugui tancar també amb la X
look also chrash on exiting thread is still open when 2 chronopics are used
i think test button has to be pressed on both chronopics when test is ended

Add Cabedo's tests

add a link to the server page. Develop web stats and survey on web site. Maybe
done by R script and calling to database

all this will be release 0.9

do the ping gets real IP

put thread in other server situations:
-upload evaluator
-upload session

every string that gets on server or complex object, sanitize it: see on sql or
c# books. Or look for ; and after alter, insert, delete, drop, update, ...
(low and hight case)
i think there will be no problems because all is parametrized

Put pictures and description of runAnalysis. Do svn add, Makefile, ...

Add longDescription on margaria


intersession stats only have to show one max or avg, not n max or all jumps
stats all and limit is not updating the treeview stats. 

create a server mini program that tries to do a ping and if it fails, 
then write something in a file, and another program restarts server
fo it as to chrons. Record some stat data in another file
just to know how xsp2 is working
