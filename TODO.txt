TODO: 

fix two bugs (really difficult to reproduce):
1.- the chronojump.cs findVersion (just do more tests check that the error is fixed easily) 
work done (30 apr (2)), just do more tests
2.- the sqlite problem with the thread at start... need to explore more

multiChronopic:
-repair
-tempTable
-upload server

new multichronopic tests:
- padu runAnalysis (2cp): out of jumpRj and going to multichronopic (also in menu)
- discrimitative reaction time with two lights and two fotocells (or platforms)
(4cp) when evaluator push left or right button, cp 1 or cp2 lights, person has to cross fotocell a or b (connected to cp 3, 4)
better with only two chronopics, if evaluator push cp1, light1 gets on and person has tocross fotocell1 (or platform). Then with two we have all.
we can also have three or four to have more discriminative


server: study possible locks, see sqlite book

done by R script and calling to database

do the ping gets real IP

implement all server evaluator SAFE stuff 

put thread in other server situations:
-upload evaluator
-upload session (doing) pending to generate wsdl proxy in order to download

every string that gets on server or complex object, sanitize it: see on sql or
c# books. Or look for ; and after alter, insert, delete, drop, update, ...
(low and hight case)
i think there will be no problems because all is parametrized

Put description of runAnalysis
Put description of reactionTime

Add longDescription on margaria

Update manual


intersession stats only have to show one max or avg, not n max or all jumps
stats all and limit is not updating the treeview stats. 

create a server mini program that tries to do a ping and if it fails, 
then write something in a file, and another program restarts server
fo it as to chrons. Record some stat data in another file
just to know how xsp2 is working


merge databases

	we can check the lines we need, and execute, and if a line it's not found, try to discover wich values are needed
