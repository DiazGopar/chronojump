mirar crash a l'obrir-se eventexecute window a WINDOWS
	mirar que no es quedi mort si no es fa clic a la plataforma després del runAnalysis, si es queda mort llavors que no es pugui executar cap test, que es quedi tot insensitive fins que s'apreti la platforma

website velleman put retardo de desactivacion instead of tiempo de respuesta ajustable



++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ solved +++++
runAnalysis bug it's always:
- when calling error window (gui/chronojump.cs 2805 (between cfmt5 and cfmt6) (try catch seems not to work) now print writelines from error window, let's see
-maybe is because first cp kills the PulseGTK and then 2nd cp has no access to this PulseGTK (because thread is killed) (and maybe it cannot end it's work or repaint screen or whatever) then need another pulse for 2nd cp, or just the 2nd cp is the one who has the real finish:
first cp has a trigger on finishing
second cp when knows that trigger

what should happen:
1 when first cp ends (arrive 2ns photocell)
2 it does the finish
3 message printed to user (press cp2)
4 cp2 is pressed 
5 totallyFinished 2 is displayed
6 all is over

------------
ATTENTION:
gui/chronojump.cs line has been commented:
currentEventExecute.FakeButtonFinished.Clicked += new EventHandler(on_multi_chronopic_finished);
and nothing is written (as run analysis and as mc) and nothing is in treeview
but never fails!!!!!!!!!
maybe is simple problem that on_multi_chronopic_finished calls on_finish_multi_clicked and later continues with it's code
maybe is a bad call, try to uncomment the Fake again, but comment this call:
on_finish_multi_clicked(o, args);
-aixi funciona perfectament (provat amb 13runA) i guarda dades i fa treeview, l'unic que cal recrodar-se de fer el click al cp2 després del cp1

ATTENTION2:
*** seems that no errorwindow or dialogmessage can be used until pulseGtk code is ended ***
maybe SOLUTION is to show a message on eventWindow from pulseGTK, and not from gui/chronojump with the 4 TotallyFinished calls

fix two bugs (really difficult to reproduce):
1.- the chronojump.cs findVersion (just do more tests check that the error is fixed easily) 
work done (30 apr (2)), just do more tests. added a try catch, hope it's done now
2.- the sqlite problem with the thread at start... need to explore more

multiChronopic:
-syncFirst and deleteFirst are not working now
-export!!
-repair
-tempTable
-upload server


new multichronopic tests:
- discrimitative reaction time with two lights and two fotocells (or platforms)
(4cp) when evaluator push left or right button, cp 1 or cp2 lights, person has to cross fotocell a or b (connected to cp 3, 4)
better with only two chronopics, if evaluator push cp1, light1 gets on and person has tocross fotocell1 (or platform). Then with two we have all.
we can also have three or four to have more discriminative


server: study possible locks, see sqlite book

done by R script and calling to database

do the ping gets real IP

implement all server evaluator SAFE stuff 

put thread in other server situations:
-upload evaluator
-upload session (doing) pending to generate wsdl proxy in order to download

every string that gets on server or complex object, sanitize it: see on sql or
c# books. Or look for ; and after alter, insert, delete, drop, update, ...
(low and hight case)
i think there will be no problems because all is parametrized

Put description of runAnalysis
Put description of reactionTime
Add longDescription on margaria

Update manual


intersession stats only have to show one max or avg, not n max or all jumps
stats all and limit is not updating the treeview stats. 

create a server mini program that tries to do a ping and if it fails, 
then write something in a file, and another program restarts server
fo it as to chrons. Record some stat data in another file
just to know how xsp2 is working


merge databases
